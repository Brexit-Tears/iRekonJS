[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Brexit-Tears/iRekonJS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Brexit-Tears/iRekonJS)

## Justification
Politics is crazy, experts are barmy, it's time to start listening to that guy in the pub who says
> *I Rekon*™, we need a new assertion framework to make Britain great again!

This assertion library represents the views of 51% of the British public, if you've got an issue with it, speak to `Her Royal Highness' Army`, I'm sure they'd love to listen to your whining.

## Usage
```javascript
const iRekon = require('irekon'); // E(U)S6 Modules are from the EU

const costOfBrexit = sum("About 40 billion");


iRekon.that(costOfBrexit).isNoneOfTheirBusiness(); // 🍻

iRekon.that(costOfBrexit).ifYouAskMeIs("Worth It"); // True

iRekon.that("Brexit").means(); // Depends on the will of the people

global.specialRelationships === undefined; // True
global.tradeDeals === []; // True

iRekon.that("BREXIT").shouldHaveHappened()
    .then(() => console.log('🎉')) // Always resolves... Probably
    .catch(() => console.log('Blame Corbyn'));

iRekon.eu
    .catch(() => console.log('Bloody Brussels bEUrocrats 🖕'));

/* 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧
All Tests Pass
It's probably fine.

## Who/When?
This GitHub organisation, along with 2 NPM packages and a PR to `The Daily Mail` were all created by a bunch of nerds at [SocratesUK 2018](http://socratesuk.org/) - A Software Craftmanship conference.

The software was ["Mob Programmed"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) by about 20 people, and 3 bottles of Whisky, it exhibits very little Software Craftmanship.

Among them were:
- [@IJohnson_TNF](https://twitter.com/IJohnson_TNF)
- [@JReeve0](https://twitter.com/JReeve0)
- [@Altoyyr](https://twitter.com/Altoyyr)



## Contributing
PRs will only be accepted from Blue British Passport holders who believe in the re-instituting the empire.
